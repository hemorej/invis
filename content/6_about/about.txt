Text: 

Born in Beirut in 1988, I'm a photographer and printer living in Montreal, Canada. I started making pictures in the early 2000s and have been printing since 2012.

In my photography I look for the lyrical and poetic in the everyday. My interests follow themes of solitude, wonder and the ephemeral quality of life and film. I love the photographic process and the slow, meditative pace of film. Making photographs has become a part of my daily routine, I rarely leave the house without my camera. 

Signed, unmounted prints are made by myself on Ilford FB (baryta) paper from black and white negatives. Check the store section if you would like to buy one.

The name of the website is from an Italo Calvino book, its layered, poetic and sharp texts inspired a lot of my early explorations and still inform my work to this day.
