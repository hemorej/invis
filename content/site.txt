Title: the invisible cities

Author: Jerome Arfouche

Description: The Invisible Cities is a visual journal of life in the city, documenting and continuing in a subtle street photography tradition. To wander the Cities is to see and observe, to know the streets, walk, get lost in other places. It is to wait for the fleeting moments that pass unseen, the hidden mysteries. It is an unfinished story.
