Text: June 30: I walked towards the stairs to the overpass when a man ran out, looking halfway between afraid and lost. He was holding his hands in front of him and they were covered with thick dripping blood. I only slowed down a little to make sure I saw what I saw, then I ran up the stairs as I heard the train coming. Just as the doors were closing I remembered I forgot to buy water.
