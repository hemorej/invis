Text: Nov 28: For days it lays low, like a disease, only tamed never defeated. For weeks not a hint of its presence. Then I feel it coming. It's not quite here, it's still in a safe distance. It's like watching a storm from your front porch, it's somewhat intimidating yet safe at the same time. I feel the thoughts starting to race, the pace picking up. Control. I can't sit for too long, I have to get up and walk around. I'm a bit colder than usual. I'm jittery, I open, close and reopen the same tab three times only to forget what I was trying to do. Breathe is a bit short.
