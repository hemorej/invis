Text: June 28:the very idea of loneliness is a fallacy. one cannot be completely alone. in the company of others we are not alone, in the presence of others we are distant yet there, and in the complete absence of others there is still the mind. your very mind which expands to fit the voice of a crowd, conflicting thoughts, noise. One wishes to get away, to be alone, in fact, not from others, but perhaps from ourselves. To be free of our own mind is ultimate freedom. To be chained to our thoughts is slavery, even in the absence of people. If anything, perhaps, it is in the presence of others that we are closest to being by ourselves. As the collective thought engulfs the individual and muzzles the ideas, we can pull on the chains a bit farther
