Text: July 16: Reality is a shy creature whose habitat treads on the outside world, the world inside your mind and the border in between. That last line is a moving sponge, sometimes absorbing sometimes flooding, sometimes retreating sometimes advancing. At times so thin one does not know where the real is, and where the imagined interpreted fiction is. The mind expands to fill space with ideas and thoughts and objects internal to us but which we perceive as real as the ground we stand on.
