edit always requires the longest time of any step in the process. Very few photographs I know will make the series as soon as I see them, most will stay there indecisively, shuffling around, getting cut out and brought back. Shuffling the order is important, it forces me to see new sequences and connections where before I didn't. Some new photographs make their way in the selection like this. 
If I feel I'm getting stuck, I'll leave the selection for some time, to let it sit while I work on something else. This affords me more perspective and a bit more of an objective eye. I tend to leave some pictures in the set which I'm more emotionally attached to that might otherwise not really belong there.

The idea is to arrive at the most interesting set through successive iterations of selections

Some hard decisions involve excluding strong pictures that are perhaps too strong for the set (they stand out too much and overshadow the rest). For some pictures, the only way to really tell whether to exclude them or not is by making a print. At various points in this stage I'll go to the darkroom with a 10-15 item list of frames to print. 
Printing really puts on paper what I had in mind when I first shot something, or reinterprets it in a new way. Either way, the print is the reference for what it will look like in the set. Printing often helps me further edit down a set.

If it sounds like I'm mostly discarding photographs, it's essentially that for the early editing stages.

cropping is a contentious issue among photographers.
