finding inspiration
what to do when stuck
where new ideas come from

try another kind of film, a different focal length

set goals, shoot one rolle a week for example, 20 prints a month

timeboxing for an hour, or an amount

scheduling breaks or non-productive days 

writing down progress (weeknotes)
