## Starting a new project

I've started projects in many different ways, the most common being: by going on a trip, by going back in my negatives or by actively developing an idea and going forward.

I always carry my camera with me whenever I go. Work commute, supermarket, walking the dog... nowhere is too trivial to have it with me. A lot of the time I don't shoot anything. I almost never go somewhere specific with an idea in mind to shoot. I find it difficult to work in this way, I'd rather shoot in a more improvisational manner wherever I happen to be. I don't prepare shots or study locations, but I do often come back to places and shoot them over and over again. Some corners I've seen many times in every season, I've accumulated hundreds of shots with very small variations. Shooting is almost like a meditation. I have to be solidly in the present with a clear mind and no distractions, otherwise it doesn't work. I pay attention to the surroundings, the light, people coming and going. I can't work while holding a conversation for example, in fact my preferred way to work is alone. There's nothing like walking around endlessly, with no particular aim, back and forth between streets and neighbourhoods, wondering what the light will be like in an hour, stepping in a shop to see what the frame looks like from inside, waiting for an hour on the same corner, stopping randomly to burn half a roll on a detail.

I try not to set out in a editing mode while shooting, that is trying to fit the pictures I see in front of me into a series or wondering how it'll serve or why I'm shooting. I shoot liberally, trusting my instinct and leave the decisions for later. If I see something however that does feel like it could fit a series I'm working on then I'll try to work many angles and get as many interesting shots as I can. 
It's a balance of being totally spontaneous and open and keeping an eye out for what could serve my ongoing project of the moment.

The easiest way to make a series usually comes after a trip. Since the trip has a beginning and an end the work is self-contained and the topic is given. All the material is right there and it's usually about the place I'm visiting. I usually develop the film right away when I return, but I don't edit them. I check them out of curiosity but no work begins at this point.

Another way to compose a series is by going back and poring over old negatives, whether by accident or deliberately. The eye, the methods, subject affinity are always evolving and I can sometimes find great things in old negatives that I had overlooked. The perspective time affords also helps. This has never led to a series being actively developed, though I don't exclude this. But as with a trip, usually the work is self-contained though the subject may not be very obvious or easy to develop.

The most interesting and challenging method is by actively developing an idea and going forward with it. Sometimes I'll find myself shooting along a certain theme. That can be totally by chance, since I try to shoot in a spontaneous way. It can also be a decision to go after an idea, though it's always very vague at the inception ("snow" or "night colour"). The theme stays in the back of my mind and I'll continue shooting for a few weeks without developing anything. I'll shoot to see how much material there is to work with, it's a kind of test to gauge how interesting the idea is. 
The goal is to accumulate shots to begin any kind of composition.

## on shooting
how do i shoot
my influences and turning points
lots of frames with small variations, involves lots of standing around staring at something shifting a bit forward or back framing it in my mind, sometimes it's a single shot
I'll come back on other days and make more shots of it in different light or at a different time
shooting is irregular, sometimes I'll shoot a lot in a small period then go through weeks of little to no shooting with all the emotional that accompany it. I usually feel better when I'm shooting and can worsen the longer I'm not shooting
