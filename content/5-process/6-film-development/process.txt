I've been developing film for almost as long as I've been shooting film. It's a great way to save money and get the exact look you're looking for on your negatives. While there's many variables and different recipes, it's a lot less difficult than it seems and once you get the hang of it it's very easy. The following method is by no means the only way to do it, it's my own method and intended to be a guideline to anyone looking for a starting point. It's intentionally simplified to be as accessible as possible, but keep reading below for more advanced notes. A lot of the tools I use (like the siphon washer) aren't strictly required but they can make it easier or faster. 

## What you need:
- Film
- Developer
- Fixer
- A development tank and reels
- Mixing jugs and graduated cylinder
- Darkroom thermometer
- Scissors, plastic sleeves
- Timer

## Step 1: Preparing the chemicals
Always use gloves when mixing chemistry to protect your skin!
I usually fill a bunch of bottles of water at 20ºC (68ºF) in preparation for this.
Once you've chosen your developer, mix with water at the appropriate dilution while stirring. The standard notation for dilution is 1+X, meaning 1 part developer in X parts of water. For example, 1+25 is 1 part developer and 25 parts water. The tank you use should say how much total solution you need, for example mine needs 290mL per roll of 35mm, so in the previous example I would need 11.15mL of developer and 278.75mL of water for a total of 290. 
Prepare the fixer too and keep a jug nearby because the fixer can be reused.

## Step 2: Loading the film
This step is done in total darkness! You can use a changing bag but it's very important that there's no light at all while you do this as you can ruin your film.
Cut the leader off, and start loading the spool with the film, then cut the end off when the film is entirely loaded. With a Paterson reel, you do this with a back and forth twisting motion that loads the film onto the reel as you turn. Put the reels in the tank and close it tight.

## Step 3: Development
You can turn on the lights again. 
Get your timer ready and pour the developer in. Invert slowly and continuously for the first 30 seconds. Then every minute, invert 3 times over 10 seconds, making sure to turn the tank. This is to keep fresh chemistry in contact with the surface of the film for even development.

## Step 4: Fixing
When the time's up for development, pour the chemistry out. Many people use a special stop bath here, but I simply do a quick wash for a minute. This is to make sure the chemical reaction of development isn't still ongoing. Then pour the fixer in and time it. As with the developer, invert continuously for the first 30 seconds, then 3 times every minute.

## Step 5: Washing
When the time's up for fixing, collect your fixer in a jug if you plan to use it again. Wash your film in fresh running water at the same temperature you used for development for about 5 minutes. I use a siphon to force wash the film and then quickly dip it in a bath of Kodak photo-flo. Photo-flo reduces surface tension of water and makes it dry more evenly, I then do a final rinse in distilled water. It's not required, but the water is hard where I live and that can leave drying marks on the film.

## Step 6: Drying and storing
Hang the film to dry in a clean environment without dust. It should be completely dry in about 3-4 hours at which point you can cut it and put it away in archival sleeves for storage.

## Notes on developers

There's many different developers to choose from, but they all serve the same purpose. For a few years I experimented with a few to find the one I like best and I suggest you do the same but good general purpose developer to begin is Ilfosol. 
Here's a short list of some that I've used:
- Rodinal (also known as R09 or Blazinal). A highly concentrated liquid developer with a centennial formula. Great for one shot use, almost never expires. Gives great sharpness but is very sensitive to agitation, mostly designed for slow films.
- Ilford HC, Kodak HC-110: Highly concentrated modern liquid developers, great if you have a lot of film to develop. 
- Kodak D76, Ilford ID-11. Great general purpose powder developers, these give a more classic look. Can be used for pushing, but mosty designed for box speed development.
- Ilford Microphen. My favourite developer, designed for push processing. Fine grain and a lot of shadow details without exploding the highlights.

Most developers can be used at different dilutions. For example, Microphen can be used undiluted (1+0, or stock), at 1+1 or at 1+2. The more you dilute the more economical it becomes (one box of Microphen develops 3 rolls at 1+0, 6 rolls at 1+1), but the more time it takes. Some developers can be reused with replenishment, that's great if you have a long session with lots of film. Kodak and Ilford both produce excellent, clear and reliable documentation for their developers so it's very informative reading.

## Notes on contrast

There's a few variables you can control to affect the way your negatives look. While different developers will give you slightly different looks, agitation and temperature are the most consequential.
The more vigorously and frequently you agitate, the more grain and contrast you will get. The opposite is true but you want to agitate a minimum to get an even development. Similarly, higher temperatures will also give more grain and contrast, but it's important to note they shorten development time. You can experiment with these to your advantage to get the desired look, but the important thing is consistency. Once you've decided on a temperature for your development session, all the solutions should have the same temperature throughout the whole session. Similarly, If you decide to invert every 30 seconds, do that for the entire session.
As a general rule, it's good to go for medium contrast negatives. High or very low contrast negatives are very hard to print and you can't change that once the film is developed. However, it's easier to increase or decrease contrast while printing if your starting negative is flexible.

## Mistakes I've made

- There's another dilution notation which is in the form of 1:2. Here the total is 2 parts, so this means 1 part developer and 1 part water, unlike 1+2 where the total is 3 parts, 1 part developer and 2 parts water.
- Keeping the water temperature constant is going to be your biggest headache. Film is quite sensitive to temperature changes and it should be kept within ±1 degree throughout the whole process, including washing time.
- Make sure you invert rather than rotate using the supplied rod. It can lead to streaking on the negatives, inversions give a more even development.
