no more active shooting, but maybe re-edit, re-sequence, add or remove pictures

never quite done editing. I'll keep coming back to a set if i see changes in it, things I want to update, sequences, a reprint, exclude or include more photographs. The set will keep changing between editing iterations or cycles of shooting and editing which brings new material to the set. I'll keep making edits until there's almost no changes, I'm satisfied with the printing, the sequencing and the set selection as a whole. This might change in the future again, but for now it's an indication that it's ready for the next step
