# Some technical notes

This is a short article about the technical choices I usually follow in my work. I've arrived at these decisions after a lot of experimentation over the years and they're directly informed by my printing. 

## Film

I shoot Ilford HP5+ almost exclusively. A few months ago I decided to start bulk loading my own film, mostly to try to save some money. Like most popular 400 speed films, HP5+ comes in 100' rolls. Other films I've tried that I like are Rollei RPX 400 (which I shot at 800), Ilford FP4+ (which I shot at 400), the defunct Fuji Neopan 1600 (shot at 800) as well as Ilford Delta 3200 and Kodak TMax 3200 (shot at 1600). HP5+ at 800 gives me a bit more contrast, some margin to shoot when there's less light and the ability to shoot quickly at hyperfocal during the day.

My volume varies, but I shoot about 40-50 rolls a year (more if I travel) and the vast majority of my work with a 35mm lens.

## Development 

Ilford Microphen is my favourite developer, it's specifically formulated for pushing which I do almost all the time. It gives rich grays in the midtones, doesn't blow up the highlights and a lot of detail in shadows with a smooth, sandy grain that's visible but not overpowering. 

I usually wait until I have a small backlog of films and then develop them all at once, 6-18 rolls per session usually.

## Printing

I print almost always on Ilford Multigrade FB Classic Matt paper. I like the softer look of matt paper and the size of 8x10" paper. It's big enough to hold and to see detail, but small enough that you have to get a big closer to see it when framed. Often I print using the split grade method, other times I'll print with a high grade if I'm looking for a specific look. 

I usually make about 10 new prints per session of 5-6 hours.
