## First editing of a new project

The first edit of any project is an important one because it's the first time I actually see what I'm working with and how interesting it actually is as opposed to how interesting it was in my mind when I shot it. I don't work in a linear, sequential way. Over the course of a series I'll do many cycles of shoot-edit-print-selection, but the first time I see the pictures has always been the one most decisive for the series. At this point I can decide to stop shooting the project or take it in a new direction.

I'll develop my backlog, make contact prints of everything and start noting the interesting frames. "Interesting" at this step is a very loose definition. It's a collection phase, not unlike shooting and I try to cast a wider net at first, not to miss anything. I usually keep about a third of the shots I have. Once I have my selection I need to take a closer look at them. I've used two different ways to do this and haven't really settled on one method. I can either make small 4x6" work prints or do quick low resolution scans on the computer. One will save me time, the other money. Either way, now I have a slightly better idea of what I'm working with.

I'll usually collect similar shots together and start a process of elimination to keep the most interesting and those that fit with the others. This is a more selective step but I still have quite a bit of material to work with. This is the initial batch from which I'll make all other selections later. Any future additions will go through the same collection stage, join this set and the whole will then again go through a selection stage.

slow decisions, come back over and over, keep long list and short list
keep a decision queue to consult later


first edit looking for patterns I may have missed while shooting, in subkects, composition etc
maybe write up a project statement, as a guideline or future reference. always subject to amend and change
