## First editing of a new project

The first edit of any project is an important one because it's the first time I actually see what I'm working with and how interesting it actually is as opposed to how interesting it was in my mind when I shot it. I don't work in a linear, sequential way. Over the course of a series I'll do many cycles of shoot-edit-print-selection, but the first time I see the pictures has always been the one most decisive for the series. A lot of the times I'll decide to shelve it
