A few months ago I decided to start bulk loading my own film, mostly to try to save some money. I shoot Ilford HP5+ almost exclusively, and like most popular 400 speed films, it comes in 100' rolls. Bulk loading looks more complicated than it actually is. We only need to invest in a bulk loader and the rest is straightforward.

## What you need
- A bulk loader. I use a Lloyd Daytime Bulk Film Loader which I found online for 30$. Another well-known model is the Bobinquick-135 AP 35mm Bulk Film Loader.
- Canisters. I save all my 35mm canisters after development and reuse them here. You can also buy specially made plastic canisters, but reusing old ones saves extra money.
- A 100' roll of your choice of film.
- Scissors, tape

## Step 1: 
In complete darkness, or inside a changing bag, open the box of film. The film is tightly wound but the centre might start to unravel when you take it out. The end of the roll is taped, take it off and load it onto the central plastic rod and put the whole thing inside the loader. Keep a bit of film sticking out to get you started and close the top back on. You can turn on the lights now !

## Step 2:
Pull out the remaining film from the canister and tape it to the edge of the roll coming out of the loader. Here I usually roll the taped bit into the canister, snugly fit the canister in the small chamber in the loader and close it shut.

## Step 3:
Insert the rewind handle making sure its notches align inside the film canister. I've broken a few canister tops pushing too hard when they weren't well aligned. You'll know it's secure when the rewind handle fits all the way down. 

## Step 4:
Slowly turn the handle clockwise. Pay attention to any change in resistance or tension as you do, that'll indicate whether there's a problem loading the film. It should feel quite smooth with no abrupt resistance or friction as you roll it in the canister. 
When you've made the required amount of turns (30 turns gives me about 36 exposures), pull out a bit of leader and cut.

## Step 5: 
Cut the leader to roughly match the curve they usually come in. This is allow the film to be taken up by the camera spool. I count six perforations and cut diagonally. When in doubt, count more sprockets. Make sure you always cut between holes and that the line is pretty high, otherwise the film won't take up on the spool. 
Repeat !
