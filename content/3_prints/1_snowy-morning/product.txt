Title: Snowy morning

----

Description:

It was one of the last big storms of the year and when I got out in the morning the snow was already very high. I was on my way to work when for a brief moment, I saw the person go in the station. I wiped the foggy window with my sleeve and had time for just one shot before they went away.
