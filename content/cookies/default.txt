Cookies are small bits of information stored on your computer to help websites remember something about you. They're not inherently good or bad, it depends on their usage. For example, without cookies a website wouldn't be able to remember what you put in your shopping cart, but some websites also use cookies to keep track of what you browse. Most websites on the internet use cookies.

The Invisible Cities only collects information provided by users and which is necessary to process orders relating to its shop. This information is shipping and billing address, name, email and phone number. These are strictly used to process the order and to notify you of order updates. They are not shared with or sold to any third parties, and only one person has access to this information behind a secure gateway. The Invisible Cities store also uses Stripe for payment processing, payments are governed by its respective privacy policies. All communication is done over HTTPS to ensure sensitive data is protected from unauthorized viewing and no payment information is stored by the Invisible Cities. Disabling cookies related to these payment gateways will prevent the site from working properly and would be unable to process orders.
